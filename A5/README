============================================
COMPILATION:

Run the default premake4/make combination:
    > premake4 gmake
    > make
Run the compiled A5 file with puppet parameter:
    > ./A5 Assets/room.lua

Nothing new necessary.

============================================

MANUAL:

Enjoy the show!

Note: Make sure you have sound on.

See CS488 Project Objectives.pptx for screenshots of objectives.

In case I cannot get sound to work in the demo, I have prerecorded a video of it at backup-video.avi (Low FPS)

NOTE: Only certain computers in the graphics lab can get sound working. I tested on gl42.
